Objective: 
To develop an ML-powered system to automatically verify key aspects of B2B sales contracts our target being MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) and to predict projections for future contracts based on the growth of the business aligned with the Budget of 2024.

Problem Statement:
In the fast-paced world of B2B sales, managing and verifying contracts manually is a time-consuming and error-prone process especially for small scale industries.
Contracts often contain complex terms and conditions that need thorough review to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards.
Manual verification can lead to inconsistencies, missed clauses, and potential legal risks.Additionally servicing companies often attempt to overprice their services to the client company.
Companies end up paying more than what is required for the same service due to unaccounted interest.

How our project is the solution:
By providing accurate projections of the interest that would be agreeable to both the business and service provider based on the previously drawn up contracts and current market standings of both parties.
The system is designed to streamline the contract management process, ensuring accuracy, compliance and efficiency in verifying contractual terms and conditions, thus reducing the risk of excess cost and errors.
